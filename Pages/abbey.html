            <h2>What is weather modelling?</h2>
            <p>Advanced computer systems are used to analyse, model, and predict the weather. Using large amounts of data, often too big for humans to handle,
                computers perform complex calculations and algorithms so humans can better understand and forecast weather trends.

                        <td>Analyse for the long term, such as 30 years into the future. Climate is a region's average weather.</td>
